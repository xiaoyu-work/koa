"""Integration tests for TripPlannerAgent — tool selection, argument extraction, response quality.

TripPlannerAgent tools:
  check_weather, search_places, get_directions, search_flights,
  search_hotels, query_events, create_event, create_task

The agent orchestrates multiple domains to produce itineraries. On the first
turn it should call check_weather, search_places, and search_hotels in
parallel (and search_flights if an origin city is given).
