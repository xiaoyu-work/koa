"""Integration tests for ImageAgent.

ImageAgent uses InputField-based flow rather than tools. It routes through
the orchestrator, collects fields (prompt, provider, size, quality), and
transitions through INITIALIZING -> WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL states.

Tests verify:
- The orchestrator routes image requests to ImageAgent
- The agent collects the prompt field correctly
- Response quality is appropriate for image generation requests
