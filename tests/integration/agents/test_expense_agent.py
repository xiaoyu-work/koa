"""Integration tests for ExpenseAgent.

Tests tool selection, argument extraction, response quality, and approval flow for:
- log_expense: Log a new expense with amount, category, optional details
- query_expenses: List expenses for a time period with optional filters
- delete_expense: Delete an expense by keyword search (needs approval)
- spending_summary: Show spending breakdown by category
- set_budget: Set a monthly spending limit
- budget_status: Show current budget utilization
- upload_receipt: Save a receipt image to storage
- search_receipts: Search saved receipts by keywords
