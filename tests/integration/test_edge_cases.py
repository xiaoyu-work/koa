"""Integration tests for orchestrator edge cases.

Covers ambiguous input, multi-item requests, unknown intents, very short
input, and purely conversational messages.  Uses a real LLM to verify the
orchestrator handles these gracefully.

Requires INTEGRATION_TEST_API_KEY to be set (see tests/integration/README.md).
