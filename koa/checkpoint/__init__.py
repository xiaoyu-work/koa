Koa Checkpoint System - Time-travel debugging and state recovery

This module provides automatic checkpointing at every state transition
for debugging and replay capabilities.

Key Features:
- Auto-save: Checkpoint saved after each state transition
- Time-travel: Restore agent to any checkpoint
- Branching: Replay from checkpoint with different input
- Tree structure: Track conversation branches

Storage Backends:
- Memory (testing/development)
- SQLite (local development)
- PostgreSQL (production)

Example usage:
    from koa.checkpoint import CheckpointManager, MemoryStorage

    # Create manager with memory storage
    manager = CheckpointManager(storage=MemoryStorage())

    # Save checkpoint
    checkpoint_id = await manager.save_checkpoint(agent, message, result)

    # List checkpoints for an agent
    checkpoints = await manager.list_checkpoints(agent_id)

    # Restore agent to checkpoint
    agent = await manager.restore_agent(checkpoint_id)

    # Replay with different input
    result = await manager.replay_from(checkpoint_id, new_message)
