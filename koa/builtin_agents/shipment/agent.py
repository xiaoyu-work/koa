ShippingAgent - Agent for all shipment tracking and management.

Replaces the old ShipmentAgent (StandardAgent) with a single agent
that has its own mini ReAct loop. The orchestrator sees only one
"ShippingAgent" tool instead of a raw StandardAgent with InputFields.

The internal LLM decides which action to perform (query_one, query_all,
update, delete, history) based on the user's request.
