"""
SmartHomeAgent - Agent for all smart home control requests.

Replaces the separate LightControlAgent and SpeakerControlAgent
with a single agent that has its own mini ReAct loop. The orchestrator sees
only one "SmartHomeAgent" tool instead of two separate ones.

The internal LLM decides which tools to call (control_lights, control_speaker)
based on the user's request.
